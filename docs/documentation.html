  <h2>Documentation</h2>
  <p>This page contains the documentation for all commands defined in class file as
  well as the accompanying package. Keywords and commands are located to the
  very left, and their command declarations (if applicable) and explanations
  are indented below them.</p>
  <p><div class="note">Note:</div>Currently, the hyperref package is required by this package to render the
  pages correctly. This will be fixed in a future version.</p>
  <p class="keyword">Content</p>
  <div class="function-declaration">
    <code class="inline-code">\content{main}{pres}{nopres}{comment}</code>
  </div>
  <div class="description">
  <p>Mandatory parameters: 
  <ol>
    <li> <code class="inline-code">main</code> - content to be shown in both versions of the file.</li>
    <li> <code class="inline-code">pres</code> - content to be shown in the presentation version of the file
      only.</li>
    <li> <code class="inline-code">nopres</code> - content to be shown in the
      non-presentation version of the file
      only.</li>
    <li> <code class="inline-code">comment</code> - comments to be shown to the right of 
      <code class="inline-code">pres</code> in the presentation
      version of the file.</li>
  </ol>
  Each of these may be any LaTeX commands you wish. They are all defined using
  the <code class="inline-code">\long</code> keyword, meaning
  that the content of each of these is permitted to contain more than one
  paragraph. This is particularly useful for the <code class="inline-code">
  nopres</code> option, as this often contains solutions to problems which can
  be quite long. 
  </p>
  <p><div class="note">Note:</div> If the comment parameter is nonempty, the
  class will draw a box around it, even if the comment parameter is just blank
  space. To avoid boxes where you do not want them, it is recommended to either use the 
  <code class="inline-code">%</code> operator in your LaTeX code immediately
  after the opening brace of the comment parameter, followed on the next line by
  the closing brace, or to simply leave the comment parameter completely empty
  like so: <code class="inline-code">{}</code>.
