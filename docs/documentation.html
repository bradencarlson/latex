  <h2>Documentation</h2>
  <p>The biggest feature of the class file is the 
  <code style="font-size: 20px;">content</code> command.
  This command takes four required arguments: 
  <pre>
  <code class="code-block">
    \content{
      main
    }{
      presentation
    }{
      nonpresentation
    }{
      comments
    }
  </code>
  </pre>
  </p>
  <p>The <code class="inline-code font-20">main</code> argument can be anything you
  want displayed in both versions of the file (theorems, the statements for
  examples and problems, etc.). </p>
  <p>The <code class="inline-code font-20">presentation</code> argument is anything
  that should be visible in the skeleton lecture notes, but not visible in the
  nonpresentation version of the file (blank space for working examples for
  example). If the <code class="inline-code font-20">presentation</code>
  option is passed to the class, this and the <code class="inline-code font-20">main</code> 
  will be shown in the first of two columns, which by default is
  7.25 inches wide (the page layout is landscape).</p>
  <p>The <code class="inline-code font-20">nonpresentation</code> argument is
  similar to the <code class="inline-code font-20">presentation</code> argument,
  only that this is only visible in the nonpresentation version of the file.
  This could be used for solutions to examples, proofs of theorems, etc.</p>
  <p>The <code class="inline-code font-20">comments</code> argument is displayed in the second
  column in the presentation version of the file, which by default is 2.25
  inches wide.</p>
