    very left, and their command declarations (if applicable) and explanations
    are indented below them.</p>

  <h3>Notes Class Documentation</h3>
  <p class="keyword">Content</p>
  <div class="function-declaration">
    <code class="inline-code">\content{main}{pres}{nopres}{comment}</code>
  </div>
  <div class="description">
    <p>Mandatory parameters: 
    <ol>
      <li> <code class="inline-code">main</code> - content to be shown in both versions of the file.</li>
      <li> <code class="inline-code">pres</code> - content to be shown in the presentation version of the file
        only.</li>
      <li> <code class="inline-code">nopres</code> - content to be shown in the
        non-presentation version of the file
        only.</li>
      <li> <code class="inline-code">comment</code> - comments to be shown to the right of 
        <code class="inline-code">pres</code> in the presentation
        version of the file.</li>
    </ol>
    Each of these may be any LaTeX commands you wish. They are all defined using
    the <code class="inline-code">\long</code> keyword, meaning
    that the content of each of these is permitted to contain more than one
    paragraph. This is particularly useful for the <code class="inline-code">
    nopres</code> option, as this often contains solutions to problems which can
    be quite long. 
    </p>
    <p><div class="note">Note:</div> If the comment parameter is nonempty, the
    class will draw a box around it, even if the comment parameter is just blank
    space. To avoid boxes where you do not want them, it is recommended to either use the 
    <code class="inline-code">%</code> operator in your LaTeX code immediately
    after the opening brace of the comment parameter, followed on the next line by
    the closing brace, or to simply leave the comment parameter completely empty
    like so: <code class="inline-code">{}</code>.
  </div>
  <p class="keyword">Phantom</p>
  <div class="function-declaration">
    <code class="inline-code">\phantom{pres}{nopres}</code>
  </div>
  <div class="description">
    <p>Mandatory Parameters:
    <ol>
      <li> <code class="inline-code">pres</code> - content to be shown when the
        presentation option is specified. </li>
      <li> <code class="inline-code">nopres</code> - content to be shwon when
        the nopresentation option is specified. </li>
    </ol>
    This command is defined using the <code class="inline-code">\long</code>
    command, so each of the parameters may be as long as needed. This command
    was included for backwards compatibility in a previous version of the notes
    class.
