  <p id="splash-description" class="splash-description">Welcome to the
  documentation for the Lecturenotes project. This LaTeX class was created to
  help manage lecture notes in two different formats in a single document:
  skeleton notes and filled out notes. 
  </p>
  <p id="splash-description-two" class="splash-description">This is achieved by
  wrapping each portion of the lecture (example, theorem, etc.) in the
  <code class="inline-code" style="font-size: 23px;">\content</code>
  command, which is provided by the class file. Once all the LaTeX has been
  written, a simple option in the document class declaration toggles what view
  the document will have.</p>
